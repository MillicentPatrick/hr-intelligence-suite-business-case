# HR Intelligence Suite: Executive Business Case

## üìÑ Overview

This repository contains an executive business proposal for the development and implementation of an integrated HR analytics platform‚Äîthe **HR Intelligence Suite**.

This project demonstrates the process of **identifying a critical business problem** (unquantified human capital risk), **designing a data-driven solution**, and **building a financial model** to secure executive buy-in. It highlights the ability to translate analytical capabilities into strategic value and a compelling return on investment (ROI).

> **Key Result:** The proposal projects a **1,148% first-year ROI** by addressing recruitment inefficiency, unmanaged attrition, unmeasured training ROI, and compliance vulnerability.

## üéØ The Problem

Human Resources is often the largest cost center in an organization, yet its metrics are frequently unmeasured or reactive. This proposal identifies four key areas of financial exposure:
- **Recruitment Inefficiency**
- **Unmanaged Attrition Cost**
- **Unmeasured Training ROI**
- **Compliance Vulnerability**

## üí° The Proposed Solution

The **HR Intelligence Suite** is conceptualized as a unified dashboard with five core modules:
1.  **Recruitment Analytics**
2.  **Attrition Risk & Cost**
3.  **Training ROI Analyzer**
4.  **Policy Compliance Auditor**
5.  **Policy Generator Pro**

## üìä Financial Analysis

The business case is built on a conservative financial model that quantifies the value of addressing each problem area:

| Value Driver | Projected Annual Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Recruitment Efficiency | `$50,000` |
| Attrition Cost Avoidance | `$150,000` |
| Training ROI | `$30,000` |
| Compliance Efficiency | `$20,000` |
| **Total Value** | **`$250,000`** |

| Cost Driver | Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| Implementation (Year 1) | `$20,000` |
| **Projected ROI (Year 1)** | **`1,148%`** |
